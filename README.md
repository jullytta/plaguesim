# Plague Simulator
## Objectives
This study is an introduction to basic concepts of discrete-event simulations. As we run experiments, we shall also have a better understanding of which factors have a greater impact on the dissemination of epidemics.

## Mathematical Model
The program will simulate the behavior of a continuous-time Markov chain. To verify its results, we will analytically calculate expected values and compare outputs.
